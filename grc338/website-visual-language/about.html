               <p>The Steeping Room was born from a simple idea: that a warm cup of tea can make even an ordinary day feel softer. We believe in the power of small rituals — the slow bloom of spices, the gentle steam rising from the cup, the quiet moment of pause. Our café was created to bring these comforts to the community through handcrafted chai, curated teas, thoughtfully sourced coffee, and baked goods made with intention.</p>
               <p>At the heart of our café is our chai and tea program, where we grind whole spices in-house, steep our chai blends slowly, and curate loose-leaf teas from around the world. Alongside our teas, we offer a small, high-quality coffee menu and a bakery selection crafted in small batches throughout the day — including chai-spiced breads, fragrant cardamom cookies, savory scones, and seasonal pastries made with care and comfort in mind.</p>
               <p>But more than anything, The Steeping Room is about connection. Our café is designed to be a gentle, welcoming space — a place where students can study, friends can meet, writers can create, and neighbors can slow down. We believe that community is built in quiet moments: in shared tables, warm conversations, and the comfort of being known.</p>
               <p>We hope that every time you walk through our doors, you feel the invitation to breathe, settle in, and enjoy something crafted just for you. At The Steeping Room, you’re not just stopping for a drink — you’re stepping into a space where warmth, tradition, and care come together in every cup.</p>
